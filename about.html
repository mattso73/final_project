            <h1>About Gym Now</h1>
            <p>Gym Now! started as an idea by Brianna Mattson. Working as a Data Analysis Consultant, Mattson was frustrated with the lack of her gym locations while traveling. Many weeks she had to skip out on going to the gym due to the inaccessibility. With the help of her colleagues, Mattson was able to partner with gyms all over the country to create a membership that worked at most gyms. Since then, Mattson has expanded the team and created the company we are today.</p>
